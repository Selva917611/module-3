# module-3
1.Get me the IP address of a particular domain (guvi.in). How do I find my CPU/memory usage of my server?. Test the connectivity between 2 nodes?
2.I have deployed an application in guvi.com:9000, and logs show my app is running, but Iâ€™m unable to view the page. Check whether my port is open or not ?
